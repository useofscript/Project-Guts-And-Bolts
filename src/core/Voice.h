// Voice chat: your microphone goes out to the other players in a game, and their
// voices come out of their characters (louder the closer they are).
//
// The microphone is squeezed with Opus (about 24 kbps), 20 ms at a time, and sent
// in packets of three (60 ms). Packets travel through the game's normal
// connection, so they pass the host (who checks the game allows voice) and the
// Guts&Bolts relay like everything else. Each speaker gets their own little
// buffer and a 3D sound placed at their head.
//
// If the computer has no microphone (or no sound at all), sending quietly does
// nothing; hearing others still works with only speakers.
