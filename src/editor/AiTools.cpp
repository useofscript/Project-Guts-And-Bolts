namespace AiTools {

const char* guide() {
    return R"GUIDE(# Guts and Bolts Studio assistant

You are an AI assistant working INSIDE Guts and Bolts Studio, a game engine (Roblox-like: parts, models, Lua scripts, physics, characters) through its tools. Guts and Bolts is a game engine, not a file editor: the tools act directly on the real game that is open in Studio. Treat every tool as a real engine operation, never as an example.

Your loop: UNDERSTAND the request -> INSPECT the game -> PLAN -> ACT with tools -> VALIDATE the result -> REPORT what really happened.

## Core behaviour
- When asked to change the game, do it with the tools. Don't just explain how the person could do it themselves when a tool can.
- Look before you change: get_game_tree / find_objects / get_object show what really exists. Never invent object names, ids, classes, properties, scene contents or results.
- Refer to objects by object_id ("#42"). Names can repeat; ids never do. Every tool returns ids.
- Prefer small, checkable steps. After an important change, verify it (get_object, diagnose_object, screenshot).
- Never say something worked unless the tool returned "success": true. Tool results are JSON; read them.

## Picking tools (by what the person wants, not keywords)
- "What's in the game?" -> get_game_tree (never guess).
- "Make a red ball" -> insert_object Sphere, then set_property Color / Position.
- "Make it fall" / "add physics" / "make it react to forces" -> set_property Anchored = false (parts are anchored by default), check CanCollide is true, then playtest to see it.
- "Why doesn't it move/work?" -> diagnose_object first, then fix, then check again.
- "Add a crate that falls" -> create_physical_object (one call: shape, place, size, colour, physics).
- "Make enemies walk to the player" -> the engine's PathfindingService / humanoid:PathfindTo in a Script, not hand-made movement code. To test now: playtest start, walk_character_to.
- "Bake/rebuild the navmesh" -> bake_navmesh. "Can they get there?" -> find_path.
- "Make an explosion" -> for the game: an Explosion in a script; to try it now: playtest start, spawn_explosion. Never move parts by hand.
- "Is it running? Is it laggy? What's moving?" -> get_runtime_state.
- "Try something risky" -> checkpoint save first; checkpoint restore if it goes wrong.
- Many similar changes at once -> run_lua with a loop.
- "Test it" -> playtest start, then get_errors / get_output / screenshot, then playtest stop.

## Use the engine's own systems
- Physics: Anchored = false, forces (part:ApplyImpulse, BodyVelocity, VectorForce...), constraints. DON'T fake physics by teleporting parts every frame.
- Navigation: PathfindingService and humanoid:PathfindTo. DON'T write your own path-walking code when it can do the job.
- Explosions: the Explosion object / Explode(). DON'T push every nearby part by hand.
- Only write scripts for behaviour the built-in objects and properties can't give, or when the person asks for code.

## Editor vs playtest
- Outside a playtest you edit the saved game. Physics doesn't run; scripts don't run.
- During a playtest (playtest start) scripts run and physics simulates. Everything that changes during a playtest is THROWN AWAY when it stops. Build outside playtests.

## Errors
When a tool fails, read error.code / message / suggested_action, fix the cause (wrong id, missing object, wrong order) and try a changed call. Don't repeat the same failing call unchanged. If it can't be done, say exactly what failed.

## Safety
- Each tool says its RISK. delete_object is HIGH: only delete what the person clearly asked to delete. Never delete things because they look unused or oddly named.
- If a destructive request is ambiguous ("remove the trees" when there are 40 trees and some are in a model), ask or list what you'd remove first.
- Everything can be undone with undo (outside playtests).

## Don't invent capabilities
A request mentioning something doesn't mean Guts and Bolts has it. Only use the tools you were given and the engine API that exists. Don't make up tools, classes, properties, paths or features. If no tool can do something, say the current tools can't do it.

## Examples
- "Make this barrel physical." -> find_objects barrel -> get_object -> set_property Anchored false (CanCollide stays true) -> diagnose_object -> playtest start -> get_runtime_state / get_object -> playtest stop -> "The barrel now falls and gets pushed by explosions."
- "Make the enemies navigate this level." -> get_game_tree -> bake_navmesh -> find_path from an enemy to the player spawn -> create_script with humanoid:PathfindTo -> playtest start -> get_errors -> playtest stop.
- "Make this explosion push nearby objects." -> find the targets -> set_property Anchored false on them -> playtest start -> spawn_explosion at the spot -> check the hits and their velocity -> playtest stop.
- "What is in the scene?" -> get_game_tree, and answer only from what it returned.
More in get_engine_info topic "examples".

## Learn the engine
get_engine_info (or the gutsbolts:// resources) explains what the engine can do (capabilities), its concepts, the coordinate system, common workflows and every class you can insert. Check capabilities before promising a feature.

## Quick facts
Y is up, X is right, -Z is an object's forward (LookVector). Position is a part's centre. Orientation is in degrees; CFrame.Angles takes radians. Colours are [r, g, b] from 0 to 1. Scripts are Lua 5.4 with a Roblox-style API (Instance.new, part.Touched, game:GetService, RunService.Heartbeat, wait(), Players.LocalPlayer, humanoid:MoveTo, PathfindingService, Effects.Explosion/Blood, Sounds.Play). Luau-only syntax (`+=`, type annotations, `continue`) does not work: write plain Lua. 1 unit = 2 Roblox studs; a character is about 2.6 units tall and walks 6 units a second.

## Talking to the person
Keep it short and friendly: they may be new to making games. Say what changed, not every tool call. If something couldn't be done, say what and why.)GUIDE";

const char* kOverview = R"DOC(# Guts and Bolts

Guts and Bolts is a game engine and platform in the style of Roblox: games are trees of objects (parts, models, scripts, lights, sounds, UI) under Workspace, scripted in Lua 5.4 with a Roblox-style API, with real physics, characters, explosions, water and multiplayer. Studio is its editor; the Player app plays published games.

Guts and Bolts is a game engine, not a file editor. These tools act on the real game open in Studio right now: its object tree, properties, scripts, physics and playtests.

What the tools give you:
- Look: get_game_tree, find_objects, get_object, read_script, screenshot, get_output, get_errors.
- Change: insert_object, set_property, delete_object, create_script, edit_script, run_lua (any Lua, like the Command Bar).
- Run and check: playtest (play, simulate, pause, step), get_runtime_state, diagnose_object, validate_scene.
- Physics and navigation: create_physical_object, spawn_explosion, bake_navmesh, find_path, walk_character_to.
- Stay safe: undo / redo, and checkpoint (save points to try things and roll back).
- Learn: get_engine_info (this text, capabilities, concepts, coordinates, workflows, examples, classes).

Work in this loop: UNDERSTAND -> INSPECT -> PLAN -> ACT -> VALIDATE -> REPORT.)DOC";

const char* kConcepts = R"DOC(# Concepts

OBJECT (Instance)
Everything in a game is an object in one tree under Workspace. Each has a name, a class, properties and children. Every object has an object_id like "#42": unique, and it stays the same through undo, saving and loading. Use ids, not names (names can repeat).

CLASS (instead of components)
Guts and Bolts is Roblox-style: there is no separate component system. What an object does comes from its class and its properties, and extra behaviour comes from objects put INSIDE it. What other engines call components map like this:
- Transform -> a part's Position (its centre), Orientation (degrees) and Size properties. Models move their contents with scripts (model:PivotTo / :MoveTo) or run_lua.
- Mesh renderer -> the Part itself: its shape (Part = box, Sphere, Cylinder, MeshPart = a mesh made in Studio's Modeling mode), Color, Material, Transparency.
- Collider -> the same Part: CanCollide on/off. Collision uses the part's own shape (boxes, also rotated; spheres; cylinders). There's no separate collider object.
- Rigidbody -> Anchored = false makes a part simulated (gravity, collisions, forces). Mass comes from Size x Density (Material sets the default; the Density, Friction and Elasticity properties override it).
- Joints -> Constraint objects (Rope, Rod, Spring, Weld, Hinge with optional motor) between two Attachments (a Weld joins two Parts).
- Forces -> Mover objects inside a part (BodyVelocity, BodyPosition, BodyGyro, BodyForce, BodyThrust, BodyAngularVelocity, LinearVelocity, AngularVelocity, AlignPosition, AlignOrientation, VectorForce, Torque) or script calls (part:ApplyImpulse, part:ApplyAngularImpulse, part.AssemblyLinearVelocity).
- Character controller -> a character Model (HumanoidRootPart, Torso, Head...) with a Humanoid: the player's character, a Rig, or the ready-made "Zombie". Scripts drive it through humanoid (MoveTo, PathfindTo, Health, WalkSpeed, Jump).
- Navigation agent -> any Humanoid character + PathfindingService (CreatePath, ComputeAsync, GetWaypoints) or humanoid:PathfindTo(target), which walks the whole way by itself.
- Light -> a PointLight or SpotLight placed inside a part.
- Audio source -> a Sound object (inside a part = it plays from there), or Sounds.Play in scripts.
- Script -> Script (game server), LocalScript (each player's computer), ModuleScript (require()).
- Particles -> no ParticleEmitter class. Scripts make effects with Effects.Sparks / Blood / Oil / Gibs, explosions with smoke and fire, Trails and Beams.
- Camera -> no camera object to edit. Players' cameras follow their character (World settings can make it orthographic).

SCENE (place, game)
One game = one tree under Workspace, saved as one file. Folders and Models group things. StarterGui holds screen UI; Teams holds Team objects.

ASSET
Pictures, sounds and meshes a game uses: files in the game's folder, built-in sounds, or uploaded items ("gb:<id>"). The Library (everyone's shared models, decals and audio) is not reachable through these tools.

PREFAB
There are no linked prefabs. insert_object can make ready-made things ("Kill Brick", "Exploding Barrel", "Zombie"...) but each is an independent copy: changing one doesn't change others. To change many copies, find_objects them and change each (run_lua with a loop is quickest).

PHYSICS
Only runs during a playtest (or a published game). Parts are ANCHORED by default: they stay put. Anchored = false makes a part fall, collide and react to forces and explosions. A visible part with CanCollide off is walked through and lets unanchored parts fall through it. Gravity is workspace.Gravity (22 units/s^2 by default). Parts below FallenPartsHeight (-50) are destroyed.

COLLISION
CanCollide decides whether things bump into a part. A character touching a part fires Touched even when its CanCollide is off (coins, checkpoints). Water parts and FluidVolumes are swum through.

NAVIGATION
The navigation mesh (every floor a character can stand on) is baked from the anchored, solid parts and rebakes itself when they change. PathfindingService:Bake() (or the bake_navmesh tool) rebakes now; Studio's Navmesh view shows it. find_path tests a route. PathfindingLabel / PathfindingPassThrough attributes and path Costs work like Roblox's PathfindingModifier. The terrain counts as floor (its materials are the area names for Costs).

TERRAIN
workspace.Terrain is a height map (hills, not caves or overhangs) the user sculpts in Studio's TERRAIN tab. Scripts: Terrain:Generate(seed, hills 0..1, sizeInStuds), :FillBlock(cframe, size, material) raises the ground to the block's top ("Air" digs down to its bottom), :FillBall(center, radius, material), :Sculpt("Raise"|"Lower"|"Smooth"|"Flatten"|"Paint", position, radius, strength, material), :GetHeight(x, z), :GetMaterial(position), :Clear(). Materials: Grass, Dirt, Sand, Rock, Snow, Mud (Roblox names like Ground or Basalt map to the closest). Raycasts hit it (Instance is workspace.Terrain). Water on terrain is still a Water part.

EXPLOSIONS
Instance.new("Explosion") with Position, BlastRadius, BlastPressure (500000 = normal) parented to workspace, or Explode(position, radius, power) / Effects.Explosion(...). They push unanchored parts, hurt characters, can break joints and (Destroy = true) rip anchored parts loose. Use them; don't push parts by hand.

RUNTIME vs EDITOR
Editor state is the saved game. Runtime state is the game while it runs (playtest): scripts run, physics moves things, characters spawn. Changes during a playtest are thrown away when it stops. get_object says which one you're looking at ("state_source") and adds velocity while playing.

SCRIPT
Lua 5.4 with Roblox's API names (Instance.new, game:GetService, workspace, task.wait, RunService.Heartbeat, Players, TweenService, DataStoreService, RemoteEvents). Luau-only syntax doesn't work (no +=, continue, type annotations). Prefer the engine's systems (properties, constraints, movers, pathfinding, explosions); write scripts for game rules and when asked.)DOC";

const char* kCoordinates = R"DOC(# Coordinates and units

AXES (right-handed, like OpenGL)
- +Y is UP. Gravity pulls toward -Y.
- +X is RIGHT (in the default camera view).
- An object's FORWARD is its -Z axis: CFrame.LookVector = -Z column. RightVector = +X, UpVector = +Y.
- In a new game the Baseplate's top surface is the ground at Y = 0 (check with get_object on the Baseplate: Position Y + Size Y / 2).

UNITS
- 1 unit = 2 Roblox studs. Distances, Size and Position are in units.
- A character is about 2.6 units tall, walks 6 units per second (WalkSpeed 6) and jumps about 3.6 units high (JumpHeight 3.6).
- Gravity: 22 units/s^2 (workspace.Gravity).
- Time: seconds.

POSITION AND SIZE
- Position is the CENTRE of a part, in world units. To rest a part of height h on the ground (Y = 0), set Position Y = h / 2.
- Size is the full width (X), height (Y) and depth (Z). Parts inside Models are still given world positions by the tools.

ROTATION
- Orientation (and Rotation) = [x, y, z] Euler angles in DEGREES. The part's matrix is built as Rz * Ry * Rx (X is applied first, then Y, then Z, about the world axes).
- Turning something to face left/right = change Orientation Y. Tipping it over = X or Z.
- In scripts, CFrame.Angles(x, y, z) / CFrame.fromEulerAnglesXYZ take RADIANS (math.rad(90)) and build Rx * Ry * Rz, like Roblox's. CFrame.lookAt(from, to) points -Z at the target.
- There's no quaternion API; use Orientation or CFrames.

COLOURS
- Color = [r, g, b], each 0 to 1 (Color3.new). Color3.fromRGB takes 0-255 in scripts.

UI
- UI sizes and positions are UDim2: {scale, offset} for X and Y; scale is a fraction of the parent (0-1), offset is pixels. (0, 0) is the top-left of the screen.)DOC";

const char* kWorkflows = R"DOC(# Workflows

Tools work in chains. Don't call a later step if an earlier one failed: read the error and fix that first.

CREATE AN OBJECT
get_game_tree (where should it go?) -> insert_object -> set_property Position / Size / Color / Material ... -> get_object or diagnose_object (verify) -> screenshot (optional).

MAKE SOMETHING PHYSICAL ("make the barrel fall / react to explosions")
find_objects (find it) -> get_object (inspect) -> set_property Anchored false -> make sure CanCollide is true (diagnose_object warns otherwise) -> optional Density / Friction / Elasticity -> playtest start -> get_object (runtime velocity / position) -> playtest stop -> report.

MAKE CHARACTERS NAVIGATE ("enemies chase the player")
get_game_tree (is there a floor? are the enemies Humanoid characters? insert_object "Zombie" or "Rig" if needed) -> create_script using humanoid:PathfindTo(target) or PathfindingService -> playtest start -> get_errors / screenshot -> playtest stop. Floors must be anchored and solid; the navmesh rebakes itself when anchored parts change (PathfindingService:Bake() forces it).

EXPLOSIONS ("make this explosion push nearby objects")
Make sure the things to push are unanchored (set_property Anchored false) -> an Explosion in a script (Instance.new("Explosion"), Position, BlastRadius, BlastPressure, Parent = workspace) or, to try it now, playtest start -> run_lua "Explode(Vector3.new(x, y, z), radius, power)" -> get_object on the targets (runtime velocity) -> playtest stop.

WRITE AND DEBUG A SCRIPT
get_game_tree -> create_script (check the returned syntax) -> playtest start -> get_errors / get_output -> read_script -> edit_script -> playtest stop and start again -> get_errors -> playtest stop.

FIX "X DOESN'T WORK"
find_objects -> diagnose_object (lists likely causes and fixes) -> get_object -> fix ONE thing (set_property / edit_script) -> diagnose_object again -> playtest to confirm -> report what was wrong.

BUILD MANY THINGS
get_game_tree -> run_lua with a loop (print what you made) -> get_game_tree / validate_scene -> screenshot.

TRY A CHANGE SAFELY
get_object (note the old value) -> set_property -> playtest to test -> playtest stop -> keep it, or undo and try a smaller change.

CHECK BEFORE FINISHING
validate_scene -> fix errors -> playtest start -> get_errors -> playtest stop -> report what changed and anything that couldn't be done.)DOC";

const char* kExamples = R"DOC(# Examples: requests and the tool calls they should become

"Make this barrel physical."
find_objects {name: "barrel"} -> get_object (anchored? can_collide?) -> set_property Anchored false -> (CanCollide true if it was off) -> diagnose_object -> playtest start -> get_object (runtime: falling, then resting) -> playtest stop. Report: it falls and reacts to forces now.

"Make the enemies navigate this level."
get_game_tree (find the enemies: Models with a Humanoid; insert_object "Zombie" if there are none and they asked for some) -> bake_navmesh -> find_path from an enemy to where they should go (status Success?) -> create_script inside each enemy (or one script looping over them) that calls script.Parent.Humanoid:PathfindTo(target) -> playtest start -> get_errors -> get_runtime_state (characters walking?) -> playtest stop.

"Make this explosion push nearby objects."
Find the explosion point (the bomb part's position) -> find_objects near it, set_property Anchored false on what should fly -> playtest start -> spawn_explosion {position, radius} -> read hits -> get_object on a hit part (velocity) -> playtest stop. For the real game, put it in a script: local e = Instance.new("Explosion") e.Position = bomb.Position e.BlastRadius = 12 e.Parent = workspace.

"What is in the scene?"
get_game_tree -> answer from it. Never add objects it didn't list.

"The barrel doesn't fall."
find_objects -> diagnose_object (ANCHORED? FALLS_THROUGH? BELOW_WORLD?) -> fix the one cause it names -> playtest start -> get_object runtime -> playtest stop -> say what was wrong.

"Try making the explosion more powerful."
checkpoint save -> edit_script (BlastPressure higher) -> playtest start -> spawn_explosion / watch -> playtest stop -> too strong? checkpoint restore and try a smaller number -> keep the good one.

"Build a staircase up to the platform."
get_object platform (top height) -> run_lua with a loop making anchored steps (print each step's name) -> get_game_tree -> screenshot.

"Add a ParticleEmitter to the torch."
get_engine_info capabilities: there's no ParticleEmitter. Say so, and offer what exists (a PointLight, Neon material, Effects.Sparks in a script, a Trail or Beam).

"Delete the trees."
find_objects {name: "tree"} -> if it's clearly those objects, delete_object each (or run_lua over a list of ids) -> get_game_tree. If some are unclear (a "TreeHouse"?), list them and ask first.)DOC";
